**SAM_Mollier** is part of SAM Toolkit that is designed to help engineers to create an Analytical Model. Welcome and let's make the open-source journey continue. :handshake:

The GitHub repository "HoareLea/SAM_Mollier" focuses on creating Mollier/Psychrometric charts, a crucial tool in thermodynamics and air conditioning design. It facilitates creating points and simulating various processes like cooling, heating, adiabatic and isothermic humidification. The repository is unique in using Grasshopper as a user interface, offering a more interactive and visual approach. This project is not only a valuable resource for professionals in HVAC but also for students and educators in thermodynamics. For more detailed information and resources, visit the comprehensive wiki at SAM_Mollier Wiki.
